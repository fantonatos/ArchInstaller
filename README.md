# ArchInstaller

After booting into the official Arch Linux installation media, download and run the installer with these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/fantonatos/ArchInstaller.git && cd ArchInstaller
./prepdisk.sh
./install-essentials.sh
```

You will be prompted several times to enter system-specific information. When the scripts indicate that installation is complete, you can remove the installation media and reboot into the working system.
